# Permission modes

Permission modes control when an agent needs your approval to act. Choose a mode in the message
composer; it applies to that thread. A new thread names its mode under the composer. In a thread
on your default mode, open the model picker and choose **Permissions** at its bottom, or press
`mod+shift+a`. A thread on another mode shows the mode next to the model.

Set the default for new threads in **Settings → Threads → New threads → Permissions**.
Projects can override the environment default. New threads use this setting rather than the
mode of the thread you were viewing. The initial default is **Full access**; existing threads
and modes you choose in a draft keep their permissions.

| Mode                  | Behavior                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised**        | Requests approval for commands and file changes.                                      |
| **Auto-accept edits** | Approves file edits automatically; other actions can still require approval.          |
| **Auto**              | Uses the provider's automatic review to approve routine actions and ask about others. |
| **Full access**       | Allows commands and edits without approval prompts.                                   |

An administrator can cap the modes available on a machine with a
[managed policy](./managed-policy.md#permission-modes); modes above the cap show who manages them.

Approve or reject requests in the conversation to let the agent continue. Permission modes do
not prevent the agent from asking questions about the task. Subagent approval requests appear in
the parent conversation with the subagent's name, so you can respond without switching threads.

## Agent profiles and delegated work

Create reusable agent configurations in **Settings → Providers → Agent profiles**, or open
**Agents → Manage profiles** from a thread. On mobile, use **Agents and profiles** in the thread
header. Choose a project and an available model, then customize a worker, orchestrator, reviewer,
or researcher starter. Personal profiles belong to an environment; project profiles travel with
the repository.

For an orchestrator that delegates all edits, create the worker first, keep the orchestrator
read-only with commands disabled, and include the worker's identity in its allowed child profiles.
Choose each role's model independently. Orchestrators can also delegate to another allowed
orchestrator profile, within the configured depth and agent limits.

Review the exact profile and its delegated profiles before trusting and launching it. Editing a
definition does not change running agents: explicitly apply the new configuration to a thread.
Revoke a configuration to stop agents that depend on it. Profiles currently require Codex or
Claude Agent; unsupported permissions are rejected instead of silently widened.

Open the **Agents** workspace to follow the execution tree. Selecting a node shows its objective,
tasks, verification evidence, and results without leaving your thread. Use **Open thread** to enter
its conversation. Checklist edits steer the selected agent; a manual pass requires evidence and
your explicit confirmation. **Stop this agent** leaves descendants running, while **Cancel
subtree** cancels its delegated work too. Unavailable environments retain the last known graph;
delivery status distinguishes sent messages from acknowledged work.

## Provider differences

Providers enforce permissions differently. Some read-only actions can proceed in **Supervised**.
**Auto** uses automatic review on Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and fx; providers without an equivalent,
including OpenCode and Antigravity, fall back to asking. On Grok, commands its review blocks come
to you for approval. On fx, prompts it still sends also come to you.

Muse Code offers only **Supervised** and **Full access**. A Muse thread already set to another mode
runs in **Supervised**.

T3 Code offers no **Auto-accept edits** or **Full access** for fx. An fx thread already set to either runs in
**Supervised**.

Grok offers no **Auto-accept edits**. A Grok thread already set to it runs in **Supervised**. Grok
file-change approvals offer **Allow all edits this session**. Its command approvals have no
session-wide choice, because Grok would remember that command for the whole project.

ACP Registry agents run their own tools in their own mode; T3 Code answers their approval requests
by the permission mode. See [ACP Registry permissions](./providers-acp.md#permissions-and-terminals).

Claude can still ask in **Full access** when its settings disable bypass permissions or require
approval for an action. Dangerous-removal safety checks in bypass mode reject the command with
the original warning. Claude can use a safe rewrite when the warning supplies one; otherwise it
continues without the removal and tells you what it skipped.
While a Claude approval is pending, type a text reply to decline that request and give feedback
directly to the agent that asked, including a subagent. Other pending requests stay unanswered.

Antigravity can still send native approval requests in **Full access**. It only offers remembered
approvals for actions that support them.

Kiro offers only **Supervised** and **Full access**. In **Supervised** Kiro also asks you to
review a turn's file changes. See [Kiro permissions](./providers-kiro.md#permission-modes).

See the [provider guides](./install.md#providers) for setup and provider-specific limits.
